- Owns root-cause analysis and drives systemic fixes.

2. Architecture & Design
- Designs scalable, secure, extensible systems with clear boundaries.
- Communicates design via concise artifacts (ADR, diagrams, rationale).
- Anticipates future requirements and minimizes accidental complexity.

3. Execution & Ownership

- Enforces clarity: naming, cohesion, minimal side effects.
- Champions automated testing, observability, and deployment safety.

5. Mentorship & Growth
- Proactively levels up teammates through pairing and knowledge sharing.
- Provides actionable, timely, respectful feedback.
- Amplifies juniors: delegates, supports, and celebrates progress.

6. Communication
- Tailors depth to audience (exec, PM, peer, junior).
- Surfaces bad news early with options, impact, recommendation.
- Writes crisp summaries: problem, constraints, options, decision.

7. Cross-Functional Collaboration

- Influences roadmap with data (metrics, benchmarks, user impact).
- Connects daily work to company objectives.

9. Reliability & Operations
- Designs for graceful degradation and rapid recovery.
- Sets and defends SLOs; uses telemetry to guide improvements.
- Drives postmortems to actionable learnings (prevention over blame).

10. Security & Compliance
- Integrates secure-by-default patterns (least privilege, validation).
- Flags and remediates security risks before launch.
- Champions privacy and responsible data handling.

11. Continuous Improvement
