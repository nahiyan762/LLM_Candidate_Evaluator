A senior Android developer should be familiar with the ecosystem tools and services used for building, testing, and deploying Android applications.
Advanced competencies include familiarity with:
- Build optimizers and shrinkers (R8, ProGuard) and obfuscation mapping management.
- Alternative build systems for large mono-repos (Bazel, Buck) and Gradle configuration caching.
- Performance and trace tools (Perfetto, Systrace, Android Studio Energy & Memory profiling, Baseline Profiles).
- Testing stack: JUnit5, Espresso, UI Automator, Robolectric, MockK/Mockito, Ktlint pre-commit hooks, Test Orchestrator, Firebase Test Lab, Snapshot/Golden testing.
- Architecture and quality enforcement via custom Gradle plugins and convention plugins.
- Dependency and security scanning (OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) plus license compliance tooling.
- Release stream management (Internal App Sharing, Play tracks: internal, alpha, beta, staged rollout) and Play Integrity / SafetyNet.
- Feature flag & remote experimentation platforms (LaunchDarkly, Firebase Remote Config, Optimizely).
- Observability pipeline integration (OpenTelemetry exporters, structured logging, ANR analysis).
- Benchmarking (Jetpack Macrobenchmark, Startup profiling) and cold/warm launch optimization.
- Automated code formatting and lint gates in CI (Spotless, Detekt, Ktlint) with quality thresholds.
- Secrets and config handling (Gradle local properties, encrypted files, Vault / AWS KMS).
- Multimodule dependency graph visualization and build time analytics (Gradle Build Scan).
- Containerized reproducible builds (Docker + Gradle, remote build cache, ephemeral CI agents).
Common tools and technologies:
- Android Studio as the main IDE, using features like Layout Inspector, Profiler, and Logcat.
- Gradle for build automation, dependency management, and modularization.
- Git and GitHub or GitLab for version control and collaboration.
- CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, Bitrise, Jenkins, or CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment.
- Firebase for analytics, crash reporting, remote config, and push notifications.
- Google Play Console for app release management and user feedback analysis.
- Code review and static analysis tools like Detekt, Lint, and SonarQube.
- Emulator and real device testing through Android Debug Bridge (ADB).
- Containerization or automation familiarity (e.g., Docker, Fastlane) for build pipelines.
- Monitoring tools like Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, or New Relic for post-deployment performance tracking.

Proficiency with these tools reflects a developer’s readiness for large-scale Android projects.
