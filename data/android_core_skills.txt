A strong Android developer must have deep understanding of the Android SDK, Kotlin programming language, and Android application lifecycle.

Core technical areas include:
- Proficiency in Kotlin and Java, with a preference for Kotlin as the modern Android standard.
- Understanding of Android components such as Activities, Fragments, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers.
- Knowledge of UI design using XML layouts and Jetpack Compose for declarative UI development.
- Strong understanding of asynchronous programming using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow.
- Efficient memory and performance management, especially handling background threads and avoiding memory leaks.
- Experience with networking using Retrofit, OkHttp, and RESTful APIs.
- Data persistence using Room database, SharedPreferences, and DataStore.
- Familiarity with Android Jetpack libraries such as LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation, and WorkManager.
- Testing fundamentals with JUnit, Espresso, and MockK.
- Familiarity with dependency injection using Hilt or Dagger.
- Understanding Gradle build system, app signing, and versioning.

Good developers write clean, modular, and maintainable code following best practices and SOLID principles.

Additional competencies:
- Architecture patterns: MVVM, MVI, Clean Architecture, modularization.
- Jetpack Compose state management and performance optimization.
- Performance profiling with Android Studio (CPU, Memory, Network, Startup).
- App security: encryption, secure storage, certificate pinning, Play Integrity API.
- Accessibility: content descriptions, dynamic font sizes, TalkBack support.
- Internationalization and localization best practices.
- Offline-first design and syncing strategies.
- WorkManager and foreground services for reliable background work.
- Play Store compliance: policies, release tracks, in-app updates.
- Crash and analytics tools: Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics.
- CI/CD: Gradle tasks, fastlane, GitHub Actions.
- Code quality: static analysis (Detekt, Ktlint), lint, baseline profiles.
- ProGuard/R8 optimization and resources shrinking.
- Handling large lists efficiently (Paging 3, DiffUtil).
- Advanced testing: instrumentation, snapshot tests, coroutine test dispatchers.
- Feature flags and remote config.
- Dependency management and version catalogs.
- Kotlin Multiplatform basics (sharing logic across platforms).
